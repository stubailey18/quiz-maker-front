# Quiz Maker (Front)

This is the React front-end of an app for building simple multiple-choice-question quizzes. I built it whilst teaching myself React. I wanted to build something that would read and write to a REST API and that included dynamic forms. It also uploads question images to [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/). 

You can see the app in action [here](https://stubailey18.com/quiz-maker). The code for the back-end part of the app is accessible [here](https://github.com/stubailey18/quiz-maker-back).
